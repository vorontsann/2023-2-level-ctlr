Working with UD format and ``CONLL-U``
======================================

During the implementation of Lab 6, you need to convert Mystem and
PyMorphy tags to the UD format and save in a ``.conllu`` file. Here you
will learn what Mystem and PyMorphy tags look like, how to convert them
to the UD format and what should ``.conllu`` file structure look like.

.. note:: UD (Universal Dependencies) is a framework for consistent
          annotation of grammar (parts of speech, morphological features, and
          syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. All this
          annotation is usually stored in a format called ``CONLL-U``, that is
          a vertical, table-like format.

Mystem and PyMorphy to UD
-------------------------

The number of available morphological features in PyMorphy, Mystem and
UD is big. It would require a lot of work to make a perfect mapping of
the features from one system to another. This section describes how to
parse the output from PyMorphy and Mystem and convert a **part of the
available morphological features** to the UD format.

You need to convert the following features:

-  POS (Part of speech)
-  Case
-  Number
-  Gender
-  Animacy
-  Tense

As different parts of speech have different tags (for example: **verbs**
have **tense** while **nouns** do not), it is important to make the
parsing per part of speech.

To convert them from one system to another, it is necessary to
understand how each system is structured.

UD
~~

The UD format for storing morphological information is structured as
follows: ``FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value...``
where ``FeatureName`` is a name of the morphological feature of the
token (for example, ``Number``) and ``Value`` is the actual value of the
feature (for example, ``Sing`` - short for singular).

For example:

-  ``Animacy=Inan|Case=Acc|Degree=Pos|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing``

   -  ``Animacy=Inan`` - inanimate
   -  ``Case=Acc`` - accusative case
   -  ``Degree=Pos`` - degree of comparison: positive/first degree
   -  ``Gender=Masc`` - masculine gender
   -  ``Number=Sing`` - singular number

.. note:: The list of all tags used in the UD system is available on
          the `dedicated page <https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html>`__.

Mystem
~~~~~~

The ``pymystem3`` library is a wrapper around Mystem for Python. It
provides the morphological analysis for the language tokens.

.. note:: The list of all tags used in Mystem is available on the
          `dedicated page <https://yandex.ru/dev/mystem/doc/grammemes-values.html>`__.

It is structured as follows:
``POS,FeatureValue?,FeatureValue?...=(FeatureValue?,FeatureValue?...|FeatureValue?,FeatureValue?...|)``
where:

-  ``POS`` is a part of speech;
-  ``FeatureValue`` is the value of a morphological feature;
-  ``?`` means that the value might not be present;
-  ``|`` means that there are several possible sets of morphological
   features for the token.

The specific structure varies based on the part of speech, see examples
below:

-  Noun: ``S,муж,од=(вин,ед|род,ед)`` OR ``S,жен,од=им,ед`` OR
   ``S,сокр=(пр,мн|пр,ед|вин,мн|вин,ед|дат,мн|дат,ед)``;
-  Adjective:
   ``A=(вин,ед,полн,муж,од|род,ед,полн,муж|род,ед,полн,сред)`` OR
   ``A=(вин,мн,полн,неод|им,мн,полн)``;
-  Verb: ``V,нп=прош,мн,изъяв,сов`` OR
   ``V,пе=(прош,ед,прич,кр,муж,сов,страд|непрош,мн,изъяв,3-л,сов)``;
-  Numeral-Adjective:
   ``ANUM=(пр,ед,жен|дат,ед,жен|род,ед,жен|твор,ед,жен|)``;
-  Pronoun-Adjective:
   ``APRO=(пр,мн|дат,мн|род,мн|твор,мн|им,мн|им,ед,жен|вин,ед,муж,од|род,ед,муж|род)``;
-  Numeral: ``NUM=(им|вин,неод)``;
-  Pronoun: ``SPRO,ед,3-л,жен=им`` OR ``SPRO,ед,3-л,жен=(дат|твор)``;
-  Particle, preposition, interjection, conjunction, part of a compound
   word, adverb, pronominal adverb: ``PART=``, ``PR=``, ``INTJ=``,
   ``CONJ=``, ``COM=``, ``ADV=``, ``ADVPRO=`` respectively.

.. hint:: For the mark 8 (when you have to fill the FEATS field
          information in the resulting ``.conllu`` file) there is no need to
          process ``PART``, ``PR``, ``INTJ``, ``CONJ``, ``COM``, ``ADVPRO``,
          ``ADV`` as they only have POS.

As it is seen from the examples above, the number of features can be
different even for the same part of speech: compare ``S,жен,од=им,ед``
and ``S,сокр=(пр,мн|пр,ед|вин,мн|вин,ед|дат,мн|дат,ед)``. This fact
should be kept in mind while parsing the morphological features.

.. important:: For the sake of simplicity, only the first possible set of
               features is considered. For example, in this set of
               features ``(вин,ед|род,ед)`` you should consider this one
               ``вин,ед``.

.. hint:: As the ``pymystem3`` returns these morphological features
          as a string, there is nothing left but to parse it by delimiters
          (``,=|()``) or find more elegant way.

Let’s parse ``S,муж,од=(вин,ед|род,ед)`` to the UD format. As the
morphological features in the UD format are structured as following:

-  ``FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value...``

the resulting string for our example would be:

-  ``Animacy=Anim|Case=Acc|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing``

.. important:: The complete mapping of features from Mystem to the UD format
               can be found in :ref:`ud-mapping-label`.

.. hint:: It’s mandatory to use ``Loc`` mapping for pymystem3 ``пр``
          case because in Slavic languages this is the only case that is used
          exclusively in combination with prepositions. A more detailed
          information you san see `here <https://universaldependencies.org/ru/feat/Case.html>`__.

PyMorphy
~~~~~~~~

PyMorphy uses the tags from OpenCorpora. The list of all tags is
available on the `OpenCorpora
Website <http://opencorpora.org/dict.php?act=gram&order=priority>`__.

As the ``pymorphy2`` returns these morphological features as an instance
of the ``OpencorporaTag`` class, it is possible to access its attributes
to extract the information.

Available attributes for ``OpencorporaTag`` are:

-  ``POS``
-  ``animacy``
-  ``aspect``
-  ``case``
-  ``gender``
-  ``involvement``
-  ``mood``
-  ``number``
-  ``person``
-  ``tense``
-  ``transitivity``
-  ``voice``

They can be accessed as, for example, ``tags.animacy`` where ``tags`` is
an instance of the ``OpencorporaTag`` class.

Let’s parse ``OpencorporaTag('NOUN,anim,masc sing,nomn')`` to the UD
format. As the morphological features in the UD format are structured as
following:

-  ``FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value...``

the resulting string for our example would be:

-  ``Animacy=Anim|Case=Nom|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing``

.. important:: The complete mapping of features from PyMorphy to the UD
               format can be found in :ref:`ud-mapping-label`.

``CONLL-U`` structure
---------------------

After processing your articles and converting Mystem and PyMorphy tags
to the UD format, you should save your annotated data in a ``.conllu``
file.

Let’s look at an example of a ``.conllu`` file that should work for you.
It is a subset of a file from `this
repository <https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Russian-SynTagRus>`__.
You can find an example text in ``ud_test.conllu`` file.

It has the following structure, where each “column” is responsible for:

-  **ID**: Word index, integer starting at 1 for each new word in the
   sentence;
-  **FORM**: Word form or punctuation symbol;
-  **LEMMA**: Lemma or stem of word form;
-  **UPOS**: Universal POS tag, mark as ``X`` if it is unspecified;
-  **XPOS**: Language-specific POS tag;

   -  **NB**: mark as ``_`` as we do not use it.

-  **FEATS**: List of morphological features structured as
   ``FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value|FeatureName=Value...`` as per
   UD format; mark as ``_`` if not available;
-  **HEAD**: Head of the current word;

   -  **NB**: mark as ``0`` as we do not use it.

-  **DEPREL**: Universal dependency relation to the HEAD;

   -  **NB**: mark as ``root`` as we do not use it.

-  **DEPS**: Enhanced dependency graph in the form of a list of
   head-deprel pairs;

   -  **NB**: mark as ``_`` as we do not use it.

-  **MISC**: Any other annotation.

   -  **NB**: mark as ``_`` as we do not use it.

Thus, during the implementation of the Lab 6, you will work with the
following “columns”: **ID**, **FORM**, **LEMMA**, **UPOS**, **FEATS**.
Fill in the rest of the “columns” as indicated in the structure above.

In addition, you must take into account that:

-  New sentences start with the token ID being ``1``;
-  Fields cannot be empty. If no value for a field, the ``_`` is used;
-  Comments usually consist of the sentences and are denoted using
   ``#``.

Let’s explain the second line
``2 советский советский ADJ _ Animacy=Inan|Case=Acc|Degree=Pos
|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing 3 amod 3:amod _``:

-  ``2`` - ID
-  ``советский`` - text of the token
-  ``советский`` - lemma of the token
-  ``ADJ`` - POS
-  ``_`` - language specific POS; none in this case
-  ``Animacy=Inan|Case=Acc|Degree=Pos|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing`` -
   morphological features of the token as per
   `tags <https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html>`__:

   -  ``Animacy=Inan`` - inanimate
   -  ``Case=Acc`` - accusative case
   -  ``Degree=Pos`` - degree of comparison: positive/first degree
   -  ``Gender=Masc`` - masculine gender
   -  ``Number=Sing`` - singular number

-  ``3`` - the ID of the HEAD for the current token. HEAD is ``период``
   in this case
-  ``amod`` - relation to the HEAD token. ``amod`` - adjectival modifier
   as per `tags <https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/amod.html>`__
-  ``3:amod`` - pair of HEAD:RELATION for the current token
-  ``_`` - any other annotation; none in this case

.. note:: More information about the structure of the ``CONLL-U``
          format is available on the `dedicated
          page <https://universaldependencies.org/format.html>`__.
